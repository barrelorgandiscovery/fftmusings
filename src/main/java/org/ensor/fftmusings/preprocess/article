Overview of process:
The Plan:
* Starting point was the original blog post on the unreasonable
  effectiveness of RNNs.
* Instead of words, why not sounds (music).
* Some others trained RNNs based on raw (time-domain) sample data.
* Instead, I thought it would be better to try Frequency domain data (FFT).
* Train a network.
* Sample it and produce original music from it.
* Training set: The complete works of the Smiths (reference).

The execution:
    * Sound -> FFT to represent frequency, phase.
    * Down-sampling FFT (diagram needed) to make the input as small as possible but still meaningful.
    * Model behavior with phase.  Did not converge.  Open question as to why this was the case.
    * Discarded phase.  What this does to the original song when phase is discarded (or made random).
        * Making phase 0 sounded very artificial (as one would expect).
        * Making phase random likewise was still recognizable, but not "realistic".
        * Observe how sound works in real life.  Precise timing between hitting two notes isn't important (i.e. phase).
          What is important is that phase, once established for a freq bucket should be maintained and allowed to vary
          slightly (small random delta from frame to frame), but should evolve slowly through the piece.
        * All of this ends up meaning that phase isn't really important to train and preserve in order
          to reconstruct a good sound, hence removing it should allow the model to start converging.
    * Hyperparameter selection:
        * Chose a hidden layer size of 1024.  This is perhaps too small to fit, but I did
          not want it to be too large and risk too much "overfitting".  At any rate, this is the
          starting point.
        * Began training with learning rate of 0.1 (default)  At this setting, it seemed
          that the shape of the curve was exponential and grew rather than monotonic decrease.  This
          seems to indicate LR too large, so started bumping it down by halfs plotting it to see
          the effect.  All curves showed a "ringing" in the shape of the model curve.
